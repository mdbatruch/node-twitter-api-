Consuming the Twitter API with Node JS. This will allow you to display your tweets from your or another user's account.

To try this out, do the following instructions after cloning to your directory:

1) cd into the folder
2) run npm install (to install node modules)
3) insert your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Keys and Access Secret into the index.js file

**In the index.js file, you can change which Twitter handle to grab tweets from and how many tweets by adjusting the screen_name and count properties in the object parameter within the client.get function.

Many more adjustments to come!!
